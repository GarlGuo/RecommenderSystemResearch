\section{Rationale behind Collaborative Filtering Recommender System}
	\subsection{User-item Interaction}
	Matrix factorization models represents the user-item interaction in a latent joint space \cite{MFinRS}. Each item $i$ is associated with a vector $q_i \in \mathbb{R}^f$ and user $u$ is associated with a vector $p_u \in \mathbb{R}^f$. The rationale behind such representation is: item $i$ will possess some unknown factors in a measure, positive or negative, stored in entries of $q_i$, and user will have different favors toward these factors, and such interest is represented as entries in $p_u$. Therefore, we can take inner product to get an approximate of the user $u$'s rating on item $i$ as \cite{MFinRS} 
	\begin{equation}
		\hat{r}_{ui} = q_i^T  p_u 
	\end{equation}
	
	Conventional SVD suffers from an incomplete (or even sparse) rating matrix. Researchers often resort to imputation to fill in the matrix, or through regularized least squared model as \cite{MFinRS}.
	\begin{equation}
		\min_{q, p} \sum_{(u, i) \in \kappa} (r_{ui} - q_i^T p_u)^2 + \lambda(\|q_i\|^2 + \|p_u\|^2)
	\end{equation}
	in which $\kappa$ is the set of known ratings. The regularizing term $\|q_i\|^2 + \|p_u\|^2$ controls the magnitude of $q_i$ and $p_u$ to avoid overfitting.
	
	\subsection{Bias}
	Early recommender system exhibit a systematic bias for users giving generally higher ratings than others or items receive higher ratings than others \cite{MFinRS}. Therefore, as Koren, et al. suggested, the entire user-item interaction cannot be simply explained by $q_i^T  p_u$, and a bias term exists. A first-order approximation of bias is as follows \cite{MFinRS}
	\begin{equation}
		b_{ui} = \mu + b_i + b_u
	\end{equation}
	in which $b_{ui}$ is the bias and $\mu$ is the overall average rating of training data, and $b_u, b_i$ are user $u$ and item $i$'s average ratings compared to the overall average rating \cite{MFinRS}. We can transform our estimated rating as 
	\begin{equation}
		\hat{r}_{ui} = b_{ui} + q_i^T  p_u 
	\end{equation}
	
	and the objective becomes
	\begin{equation}
		\min_{q, p} \sum_{(u, i) \in \kappa} (r_{ui} - q_i^T p_u - b_{ui})^2 + \lambda(\|q_i\|^2 + \|p_u\|^2 + b_u^2 + b_i^2)
	\end{equation}
